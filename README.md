This repository contains the **Omri Herman Fixed Interdimensional Bridges Model**, a speculative framework for understanding time travel and multiverse traversal through fixed, logically consistent parallel universes.

## Abstract

This model proposes that time travel does not alter the traveler's original universe but instead transfers them to a preexisting alternate universe in which their presence has always been accounted for. It avoids classic paradoxes (e.g., the Grandfather Paradox, Bootstrap Paradox) by treating universe-crossing as a deterministic and immutable event.
